After work:
- 👀 I’m interested in diving ( One of my top dive locations in the Netherlands are Zeeland and Vinkeveense Plassen )

**“People are disappearing, Harry, daily. We could only place our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we’re doomed.”** - Harry Potter and Remus Lupin. I believe, this quote can be related to big and small sets.
